1. Overview of the analysis:
      
   We are analyzing data several tables to find the number of retiering employees per title sorted in a descending order to give Bobby's manager a high level view of how many current employees are reaching retirement age.
  Also, the 2nd step identifies how many employees are eligible for mentorship program, this way the HR can make a list of employees who can be a good resource to share their personal experiecne

3. Summary 
   With current tables and SQL queries, we could provide meaning ful information to HR on the amount of people nearing retirement and to plan appropriately for hiering and possibly using existing employees to assist and train in new hiering process. 

  A new SQL querry can be explored to indentify employees with 5 to 10 years of experience. This would be a good information for HR to mix and match new hier/new talent, to maintain same level of productivity and possibly improve on it.
  
  Amother SQL query of interest would be to estimate, how many employees may take a package for retirement. This can be estimated with the number of years the employee has been with the company. This may be helpful for the company to have a totally new direction with a new set of people who can come on board and work more efficiently with new training using latest tools and skills.
